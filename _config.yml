  My name is Dionisis and I was born in 1998. I completed my undergraduate studies in Informatics at Ionian University and now I almost finished a postgraduate degree in Digital Systems Security at the University of Piraeus. Greek is my first language and I also speak English fluently with the certificate “NOCN Level 1 Certificate in ESOL International (B2)”.

          The most intrested for me

               Ionian University: I built an online pharmacy with 300 products inside from zero where you can make your online purchases with many payment methods all over Greece through a wide range of products.
               
               Ionian University: I have completed quite a few security themed projects most of them involved achieving basic security attacks. 
               
               Ionian University: My thesis was about security with a theoretical background, the title was "Issues and discrepancies in the implementation of information security incident response strategies and the role of the human factor"
               
               Univeristy of Piraeus: I completed a large coursework related to applied cryptography, Security Assessment and Exploitation of Weaknesses, Network Security, Mobile Internet Security, Digital Forensics and Security on the World Wide Web. Also, in a more theoretical level, I dealt with legislative aspects around security, such as ISO,NIST and GDPR.
               
               Univeristy of Piraeus: Now I am working to complete my postgraduate thesis. The title is "CTF Forensic Challenges" and I have to create some CTF challenges.

            In most jobs they ask about previous service where you gain your experience. I have no experience but I have a lot of appetite for work and exploring new projects. I have learned a lot in Ionian University and University of Piraeus including my courses there and my own research.

          The first Greek University, the Ionian Academy, was founded in Corfu in 1824 and was the first modern-day Greek school of modern times and the academy of the United States of the Ionian Islands. The Department of Informatics has been operating since the academic year 2004-05. The subject of the Department is both theoretical and applied Informatics.

         Ionian University gave me knowledge and helped me improve my studying skills. I think the most important thing I gained was how to work on complicated tasks and other difficulties I faced, like security or code problems. All this research was quite a challenge but I finally managed to solve everything by efficiently using the knowledge I gained.

         This university is the second-oldest business school established in Greece, while the Department of Banking and Financial Management is the country's oldest academic department in the area of finance
        description: At the University of Piraeus I managed to work under strict deadlines and the most important thing I learned  is that in the field of security you have to constantly adapt to new data and new technologies and not rest on what is already known.
